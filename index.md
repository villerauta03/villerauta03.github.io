### **_Exercise 1-5: Blockquotes_**  
#### **a**  
I read this interesting quote the other day:

>"Her eyes had called him and his soul had leaped at the call. To live, to err, to fall, to triumph, to recreate life out of life!"

#### **b**  
>Once upon a time and a very good time it was there was a moocow coming down along the road and this moocow that was coming down along the road met a nicens little boy named baby tuckoo...
>
>His father told him that story: his father looked at him through a glass: he had a hairy face.
>
>He was baby tuckoo. The moocow came down the road where Betty Byrne lived: she sold lemon platt.

#### **c**  
>He left her quickly, fearing that her intimacy might turn to jibing and wishing to be out of the way before she offered her ware to another, a tourist from England or a student of Trinity. Grafton Street, along which he walked, prolonged that moment of discouraged poverty. In the roadway at the head of the street a slab was set to the memory of Wolfe Tone and he remembered having been present with his father at its laying. He remembered with bitterness that scene of tawdry tribute. There were four French delegates in a brake and one, a plump smiling young man, held, wedged on a stick, a card on which were printed the words: _VIVE L'IRLANDE_!

### **_Exercise 1-6: Paragraphs_**

## **__Exercise 2__**  
### **_Paragraph 1: KML_**  
**KML: Keyhole markup language** is an XML-based language for expressing geographic annotation and visualization within two-dimensional maps and three-dimensional _Earth_ browsers. It was originally developed for use with _Google Earth_. It was developed by _Keyhole Inc_. (later acquired by _Google_) in 2004, and became an international standard of the **Open Geospatial Consortum in 2008**. It is also a file type (_KML file, extension: .kml and .kmz_). _Google Earth_ was the first to be able to view and edit KML files, but projects such as _Marble_ later added KML support.

### **_Paragraph 2: SGML_**  
**SGML: standard generizalized markup language** is an international standard for definition for markup languages. (A _metalanguage_) It is used to specify _DTDs_ (Document Type Definitions) A _DTD_ defines a kind of document, such as a report, by specifying what elements **must** appear in the document, and giving _rules_ for the use of document elements, such as that a paragraph _may_ appear within a table entry but a table **may not** appear within a paragraph.
